Blink stores chat history in SQLite, locally. Encrypting it is not about
hiding from anyone in particular. It's about making "the data lives on
your machine" mean something if that machine changes hands.

The short version of the options being compared:

- Encrypt-at-rest via an encrypted SQLite build (e.g. SEE/SQLCipher-style).
- Encrypt sensitive columns at the application layer.
- Full-disk encryption only, and trust the OS.

Each shifts where the key lives, which is the actual decision. More once
there are numbers instead of opinions.
